* Notice About Missing Contact Information *

You may have noticed that there is a column called 'Vendor Contact ID' in the BOM file.
The BOM file does contain the names of all of our vendors, but not the contact information (names and phone numbers) for the individuals working on our account. We do this to prevent abuse, not because we want to keep this information secret.
If you are interested in making derivative hardware, direct contact information could help speed up your project. In that case please contact us and we will consider your request together with our vendors' preferences, and try to put you in direct contact whereever possible.
We do want to help you, please contact adam@qi-hardware.com for more information.
